                 <p>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</p>
                 <span> I'm Meera Ramesh I am a Software Engineer/Full Stack
                  Developer ðŸš€ from NYC, proficient in Full Stack Web
                  Development,and passionate about Data Visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI.</span><br>
                 <span> My love for learning has been a constant in my life, and I have always been driven by curiosity.I had to put my career and my passion on hold to take care of my children. But I am here and ready to shift my focus back on to my career.</span>
                 <span>Pandemic gave me an opportunity to dedicate my free time to my passion for web development and updating my skill set on my own. While I was learning web development, I did freelance work taking on clients to build websites but I was lacking structure while learning.</span><br>
                 <span>My experiences in and outside of working with nonprofits   in addition to design consulting, have given me the analytical skills and curiosity to bring in creative problem solving when learning and using code.This led me to Pursuit, which has opened new doors and provided me with exciting prospects for my career.I am excited to be a part of a community where I can collaborate with and learn from other developers.</span>
